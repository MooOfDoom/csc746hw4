# the default value here, HBM_CACHE, exists on Cori's KNL nodes, but may not be present
# on other processors

# use the MARKER_FLAG variable to activate LIKWID's marker API, which will result in 
# perf counter data being collected only in the region of code surrounded by marker start/stop

# iterate over some number of threads. You will need to modify this for HW4 to reflect
# the levels of concurrency in the assignment

# Note: in HW4, we are NOT using OMP_NUM_THREADS to tell your program and OpenMP the
# concurrency level. instead, we tell likwid-perfctr the concurrency level,
# and then likwid-perfctr manages setting OMP_NUM_THREADS

# For the BMMCO code, you MUST make two modifications to the job-blocked-omp script that
# cmake generates from job.in:
# 1. uncomment the for loop that iterates over block sizes: for B in 4 16 63, and uncomment
#    the following line containing "do", and then also uncomment the line containing the
#    closing "done # iterating over block size".
# 2. modify the srun line where you run your program to add a -B $B to the end of the argument list,
# for example:
#   srun -n 1 likwid-perfctr $MARKER_FLAG -g $PERF_COUNTER_GROUP -C N:0-$maxcore ./benchmark-@BENCHMARK@ -N $N
# becomes
#   srun -n 1 likwid-perfctr $MARKER_FLAG -g $PERF_COUNTER_GROUP -C N:0-$maxcore ./benchmark-@BENCHMARK@ -N $N -B $B
#

for N in 128 512 2048 # loop over problem sizes
   do
   
   echo srun -n 1 ./benchmark-@BENCHMARK@ -N $N
   srun -n 1 ./benchmark-@BENCHMARK@ -N $N
   
done # iterate over problem size

# eof
